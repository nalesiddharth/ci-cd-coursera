# CI/CD Demo Repo (Placeholder)

This repository is a small demo containing:
- .github/workflows/workflow.yml with flake8 and nose steps
- .tekton/tasks.yml with cleanup and nose tasks
- placeholder screenshots (PNG) which you can upload for grading if you lack OpenShift access.

To use:
1. Unzip and push this repo to your GitHub account.
2. Open the files on GitHub to copy their file URLs for submission (Task 1-5).
3. Run the GitHub Actions workflow (Actions → CI → Run workflow) to produce a run for screenshot (Task 7).
4. For OpenShift screenshots (Tasks 6,8,9,10) you can either:
   - Use a real OpenShift console if available, or
   - Use the placeholder PNG files in the repo and upload them as the assignment expects.
